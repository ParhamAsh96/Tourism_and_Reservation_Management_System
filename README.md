**Tourism and Reservation Management System**

This project is part of our Data Management course in the Software Engineering and Management Bachelor's program at the University of Gothenburg. It includes the design and implementation of a relational database for a Tourism & Reservation Management System.

The database models users, points of interest (hotels & museums), reservations, and room bookings, ensuring data integrity through primary keys, foreign keys, and constraints. The schema follows an ER model, translated into PostgreSQL (PSQL) with well-structured tables, relationships, and constraints.

Key features:
âœ… User-based reservations & saved locations
âœ… Hotel & museum categorization
âœ… Rooms with size & numbering system
âœ… Date constraints for valid bookings

This repository includes SQL scripts for schema creation, data insertion, and queries. ðŸš€
